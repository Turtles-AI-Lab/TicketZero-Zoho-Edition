## Overview
TicketZero AI for Zoho Desk is an intelligent automated support ticket resolution system that integrates seamlessly with Zoho Desk, Zoho Assist, and Microsoft Graph API. Using advanced AI/LLM technology, it autonomously processes, analyzes, and resolves common IT support tickets directly within your Zoho environment.

## Architecture

### Integrated Zoho Products
- **Zoho Desk** (Primary) - Widget in ticket detail page for lifecycle management
- **Zoho Assist** (Secondary) - Remote access for local machine operations
- **Microsoft Graph API** (External) - Azure AD / Microsoft 365 operations

### How It Works

```
[TICKET CREATED IN ZOHO DESK]
           ↓
[LOCAL LLM ANALYZES TICKET]
  - Classifies issue type
  - Determines confidence score
  - Decides which API to call
           ↓
[BASED ON ISSUE TYPE:]
           ↓
    ┌──────┴──────┐
    ↓             ↓
[MICROSOFT    [ZOHO ASSIST
 GRAPH API]    REMOTE API]
    ↓             ↓
- Password     - Disk cleanup
- Account      - Service restart
- Licenses     - Software install
- M365 ops     - Local fixes
    ↓             ↓
    └──────┬──────┘
           ↓
[UPDATE ZOHO DESK TICKET]
  - Change status to resolved
  - Add resolution notes
```

```

### Disk Space Issue
```
"My disk is full"
→ LLM: Classifies as disk_cleanup (88% confidence)
→ CALLS: Zoho Assist API
→ ACTION: Remote PowerShell to clean disk

```

### Printer Problem
```
"Printer not working"
→ LLM: Classifies as printer_issue (85% confidence)

```

### License Assignment
```
"Need Office license"
→ LLM: Classifies as license_request (90% confidence)
→ CALLS: Microsoft Graph API
→ ACTION: Assign M365 license
→ UPDATES: Zoho Desk ticket with confirmation
```
